## 🔧 Resource Block in Terraform

### 🧠 What Is a Resource Block?

A resource block is used to create and manage infrastructure components, such as virtual machines, storage, databases, load balancers, networks, etc.

---

### 🧱 Basic Syntax

```hcl
resource "<PROVIDER>_<TYPE>" "<NAME>" {
  # Configuration arguments
}
```

- **<PROVIDER>**: The cloud/service provider (e.g., aws, google, azurerm).  
- **<TYPE>**: The type of resource (e.g., instance, bucket, vpc).  
- **<NAME>**: A local name used to refer to the resource in the Terraform configuration.  

---

### ✅ Example: AWS EC2 Instance

```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "web_server" {
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  tags = {
    Name = "MyWebServer"
  }
}
```

- **aws_instance**: Tells Terraform to create an EC2 instance using the AWS provider.  
- **web_server**: A name to reference this resource elsewhere in your code.  
- **ami**, **instance_type**, and **tags** are arguments supported by the AWS EC2 instance resource.  

---

### 🔄 Using Values from a Resource

You can use values from a resource in other parts of your Terraform configuration:

```hcl
aws_instance.web_server.public_ip
```

---

### 🔁 Creating Multiple Resources

You can use **count** or **for_each** to create multiple instances:

```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  count         = 3
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
}
```

---

### 🔐 Adding Provisioners (Not Recommended for Most Cases)

Provisioners allow you to run scripts on resources after creation:

```hcl
provisioner "remote-exec" {
  inline = [
    "sudo apt-get update",
    "sudo apt-get install nginx -y"
  ]
}
```

⚠️ **Use provisioners only as a last resort** — Terraform prefers declarative resource management.

---

### 🔍 Inspecting Resources

After applying, Terraform stores the resource data in the state file so it knows what exists and what needs to be managed.
