# ‚öôÔ∏è `provisioner` Block in Terraform

## üìò What Is It?

The `provisioner` block allows you to run scripts or commands on a local machine or remote resource after it's created or before it's destroyed.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Provisioners should be a last resort.** Prefer using provider features or configuration management tools like Ansible or Chef.

---

## üß± Types of Provisioners

### 1. `local-exec`

Runs commands on the machine where Terraform is executed.

```hcl
resource "null_resource" "example" {
  provisioner "local-exec" {
    command = "echo Hello from Terraform!"
  }
}
```

---

### 2. `remote-exec`

Runs commands on the provisioned resource via SSH (Linux) or WinRM (Windows).

```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  ami           = "ami-123456"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"

  provisioner "remote-exec" {
    inline = [
      "sudo apt update",
      "sudo apt install nginx -y"
    ]
  }

  connection {
    type        = "ssh"
    user        = "ubuntu"
    private_key = file("~/.ssh/id_rsa")
    host        = self.public_ip
  }
}
```

---

### 3. `file`

Uploads a file from your local machine to the remote instance.

```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  # ...existing code...

  provisioner "file" {
    source      = "app.conf"
    destination = "/etc/myapp/app.conf"
  }

  connection {
    # ...existing code...
  }
}
```

---

## üîÅ `when = destroy`

Use `when = "destroy"` to execute commands before a resource is destroyed.

```hcl
resource "null_resource" "cleanup" {
  provisioner "local-exec" {
    when    = "destroy"
    command = "echo Destroying resource!"
  }
}
```

## üß† Common Use Cases

| **Use Case**                  | **Provisioner Type**              |
|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Notify Slack on deployment     | `local-exec`                     |
| Run `ansible-playbook`         | `local-exec`                     |
| Configure server via SSH       | `remote-exec`                    |
| Upload config files            | `file`                           |
| Perform cleanup                | `local-exec` with `when = destroy` |

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Cautions

- ‚ùå **Not idempotent** ‚Äì Commands may run multiple times.
- üõ†Ô∏è **Hard to troubleshoot**.
- üö´ **Not suitable for production workflows** unless absolutely necessary.
- Use `null_resource` if no actual infrastructure resource is needed.

## üì¶ Full Example

```hcl
resource "null_resource" "example" {
  provisioner "local-exec" {
    command = "echo 'Deployment complete!'"
  }

  provisioner "local-exec" {
    when    = "destroy"
    command = "echo 'Cleaning up...'"
  }
}
```
