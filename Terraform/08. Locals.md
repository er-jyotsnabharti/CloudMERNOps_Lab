# 🧠 Terraform Locals

`locals` in Terraform allow you to define named values that you can reference throughout your configuration. Think of them like constants or helper variables to make your code cleaner, more DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself), and easier to manage.

---

## ✅ Use Cases of `locals`

- 🚫 Avoid repeating hardcoded values.
- ✨ Simplify complex expressions.
- 🛠️ Make large configurations easier to maintain.

---

## 🧱 Syntax

```hcl
locals {
  environment   = "dev"
  instance_name = "web-${local.environment}"
  ports         = [80, 443]
}
```

You access a local variable with the `local` keyword:

```hcl
name = local.instance_name
```

---

## 💡 Real Example

```hcl
locals {
  region         = "us-east-1"
  instance_count = 3
  tags = {
    Owner      = "Pritam"
    ManagedBy  = "Terraform"
  }
}

resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  count         = local.instance_count
  ami           = "ami-12345678"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  tags          = local.tags
}
```

---

## 🎯 Notes

- 🔄 **Local values are evaluated once** and cannot be changed dynamically like input variables.
- 📦 **They are only available within the current module.**
- 🧮 **You can use them to construct dynamic expressions**, like:

```hcl
locals {
  project_name = "pulse"
  bucket_name  = "${local.project_name}-bucket"
}
```

## ⚠️ Best Practices

- ✅ Use `locals` to simplify logic, but don’t overuse them. Sometimes it’s better to use variables or modules for clarity.
- 🏷️ Prefix complex expressions or reused strings with `locals` to make your code more readable.
