# 🔁 `lifecycle` Block in Terraform

## 📘 What Is It?

The `lifecycle` block is used inside a resource block to customize how Terraform manages that resource over time — such as preventing it from being destroyed, controlling recreation, or ignoring certain changes.

---

## 🔧 Syntax

```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = "ami-123456"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"

  lifecycle {
    create_before_destroy = true
    prevent_destroy        = true
    ignore_changes         = [tags["Name"]]
  }
}
```

## 🔍 Lifecycle Meta-Arguments

### 1. ✅ `create_before_destroy`

Ensures a new resource is created before the old one is destroyed.

```hcl
lifecycle {
  create_before_destroy = true
}
```

- Useful for zero-downtime deployments (e.g., load balancers, servers, etc.).
- Prevents service disruption.

---

### 2. ❌ `prevent_destroy`

Stops Terraform from destroying the resource — even if you run `terraform destroy`.

```hcl
lifecycle {
  prevent_destroy = true
}
```

- Helpful for critical resources (e.g., production DBs, secrets).
- Will throw an error if a destroy plan is attempted.

---

### 3. 🔄 `ignore_changes`

Tells Terraform to ignore changes to specific attributes.

```hcl
lifecycle {
  ignore_changes = [tags, user_data]
}
```

- Useful when external systems modify resource attributes.
- Prevents unnecessary drift and updates.

You can ignore:

- Entire attributes (e.g., `tags`).
- Specific sub-keys (e.g., `tags["Name"]`).

## 📦 Complete Example

```hcl
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "logs" {
  bucket = "my-logs-bucket"

  lifecycle {
    prevent_destroy      = true
    ignore_changes       = [acl]
    create_before_destroy = true
  }
}
```

## ⚠️ Tips

| **Tip**                     | **Why Important**                                      |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Use `prevent_destroy` carefully | It blocks all destroy operations on that resource.   |
| Overuse of `ignore_changes` hides drift | Only ignore things you know are safe to ignore. |
| `create_before_destroy` needs planning | Especially when resources depend on each other. |
