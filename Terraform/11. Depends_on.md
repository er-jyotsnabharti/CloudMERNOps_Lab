# 🔗 `depends_on` in Terraform

## 📘 What Is It?

Terraform automatically infers dependencies between resources based on references. However, when there's no direct reference, you can use `depends_on` to manually tell Terraform that one resource must be created before another.

---

## 🧱 Syntax

```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "app_server" {
  ami           = "ami-123456"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"

  depends_on = [
    aws_security_group.app_sg,
    null_resource.delay
  ]
}
```

---

## 📦 Example Use Case

```hcl
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "logs" {
  bucket = "my-logs-bucket"
}

resource "null_resource" "trigger" {
  depends_on = [aws_s3_bucket.logs]

  provisioner "local-exec" {
    command = "echo Bucket created!"
  }
}
```

Even though `null_resource` doesn’t reference the bucket directly, it won’t run until the bucket is created, thanks to `depends_on`.

## 🔥 When To Use `depends_on`

| **Scenario**                                      | **Why `depends_on` is Needed**                     |
|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Resource depends on something not referenced directly | To enforce the order of creation                  |
| Provisioner runs a script that needs a resource to exist | Avoids errors due to timing                       |
| Using `null_resource`, `local-exec`, or external scripts | These may not reference other resources directly  |
| Output generation or DNS setup timing             | Ensure dependent infra is already available       |

---

## ⚠️ Notes

- `depends_on` accepts a **list of resources**.
- You **don’t need to use it** if resources are already referenced directly (Terraform automatically builds the dependency graph).
- Overusing `depends_on` can make your graph harder to read and maintain — use only when needed.

## 🧠 Bonus Tip

Terraform internally creates a dependency graph before execution. You can visualize it with:

```bash
terraform graph | dot -Tsvg > graph.svg
```
