# 🌟 What are Output Variables in Terraform?

Output variables in Terraform are used to display or expose specific information from your Terraform configuration after the resources have been created or modified. These variables allow you to output values (such as the public IP of an EC2 instance or the ID of a created resource) after the execution of Terraform commands, such as `terraform apply`.

In simpler terms, output variables provide a way to access information about your infrastructure once Terraform has finished provisioning or modifying it.

## 🤔 Why Use Output Variables?
                       
- **📤 Sharing Information**: Outputs allow you to share important details about the infrastructure with other modules, scripts, or users.
- **🤖 Automation & Scripting**: Outputs can be used in automated workflows or external systems where you need to use the value of a resource (e.g., pass it to another system or another Terraform configuration).
- **👀 Human-readable Information**: They make it easier for you to see the important values after running `terraform apply`.

## 🛠️ How to Define and Use Output Variables

You define output variables in Terraform using the `output` block. Here’s the basic structure:

```hcl
output "output_variable_name" {
  value       = <expression>
  description = "<Optional description of the output>"
  sensitive   = <true/false> # Optional flag to hide the output value in logs
}
```

- **`output_variable_name`**: The name of the output variable.
- **`value`**: The value or expression that the output will display. This can be a reference to a resource or any other expression in Terraform.
- **`description` (optional)**: A human-readable description of what the output variable is showing.
- **`sensitive` (optional)**: If set to `true`, the output will be hidden (useful for sensitive data like passwords or access keys).

### 📋 Example of Output Variables

Let's say you create an EC2 instance in AWS, and you want to output the instance's public IP address after creation.

**`main.tf`**

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-west-2"
}

resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
}

output "instance_public_ip" {
  value       = aws_instance.example.public_ip
  description = "The public IP of the EC2 instance"
}
```

In this example:

- We create an EC2 instance using the `aws_instance` resource.
- The output variable `instance_public_ip` will display the public IP address of the created EC2 instance after running `terraform apply`.

### 🏃‍♂️ 1. Run Terraform:

```bash
terraform init
terraform apply
```

After applying the Terraform configuration, the public IP address of the EC2 instance will be displayed in the output.

### 📤 2. Example Output:

```bash
Outputs:

instance_public_ip = "34.212.45.120"
```

## 🔗 Accessing Output Values in Other Terraform Configurations or Modules

You can also use output values from one Terraform configuration in another by using the `terraform output` command or by referencing them in other modules.

For example, after applying your configuration, you can use the `terraform output` command to access output variables:

```bash
terraform output instance_public_ip
```

You can also reference outputs in other Terraform modules like this:

```hcl
module "another_module" {
  source = "./path/to/module"
}

output "module_output" {
  value = module.another_module.output_variable_name
}
```

## 🔒 Sensitive Outputs

Sometimes you might want to output sensitive information, such as passwords, API keys, etc. Terraform allows you to mark output variables as sensitive so that their values are not displayed in the terminal during `terraform apply`.

To do this, simply add the `sensitive = true` flag:

```hcl
output "db_password" {
  value     = aws_secretsmanager_secret.example.secret_string
  sensitive = true
}
```

With `sensitive = true`, Terraform will not show the value of `db_password` in the terminal output.

## 📝 Summary of Key Points:

- ✅ Output variables help you access and display important information after resource provisioning.
- ✅ You define output variables using the `output` block.
- ✅ Outputs can be used in automated workflows or shared between modules.
- ✅ Use the `terraform output` command to retrieve the value of output variables.
- ✅ You can mark outputs as sensitive to hide sensitive data like passwords or access keys.
