# üåç Terraform Notes

## üìå What is Terraform?

Terraform is an **op-source Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** tool developed by **HashiCorp**. It allows you to **provision, manage, and version cloud infrastructure** using simple and human-readable configuration files written in **HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language)**.

- Declarative: Define **what** you want, not **how** to do it.
- Cloud-agnostic: Supports **multiple cloud providers** (AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.) through plugins called **providers**.
- Version-controlled: Infrastructure definitions can be stored in **Git** like code.

### ‚úÖ Key Features

- Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- Multi-cloud and hybrid cloud support
- Execution plans and previews (`terraform plan`)
- Dependency graph management
- Resource lifecycle management (`create`, `update`, `destroy`)
- Modular and reusable components
