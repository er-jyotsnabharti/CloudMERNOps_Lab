# Terraform Notes

## 🌍 What Is Terraform?

**Terraform** is an **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** tool that helps you safely and efficiently **build**, **change**, and **version** cloud and on-premises resources.

---

## ⚙️ How Terraform Works

- Terraform uses **APIs** to manage and provision resources.
- It interacts with **providers** (like AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.) to communicate with different platforms and services.

---

## ✅ Common Use Cases

### 1. **Multi-Cloud Deployment**
- Manage resources across multiple cloud providers.
- Improves **fault tolerance** and **disaster recovery**.
- Use a **single workflow** for all providers.

### 2. **Application Infrastructure Deployment**
- Manage **multi-tier architectures** (web, API, DB, cache, etc.).
- Automatically handles **dependencies** between resources.
- Supports **scaling**, **monitoring**, and **rolling updates**.

### 3. **Self-Service Infrastructure**
- Teams can deploy infrastructure without depending on Ops teams.
- Use **modules** to enforce standards and speed up deployment.
- Integrate with tools like **ServiceNow** for automated requests.

### 4. **Policy Compliance and Management**
- Use **Sentinel** for policy-as-code enforcement.
- Enforce resource limits and configurations before deployment.
- Replace manual ticket-based reviews with automation.

### 5. **PaaS Application Setup**
- Automate setup for **Heroku**, **DNS**, **CDN**, and add-ons.
- Consistent infrastructure provisioning **without UI**.

### 6. **Software Defined Networking (SDN)**
- Auto-configure network based on app needs.
- Integrate with **Consul-Terraform-Sync** for dynamic updates.
- Enable **Network Infrastructure Automation (NIA)**.

### 7. **Kubernetes Management**
- Provision Kubernetes clusters.
- Manage resources like **pods**, **services**, **deployments**.
- Use Terraform **Kubernetes Operator** and **CRDs**.

### 8. **Parallel Environments (Dev, QA, Prod)**
- Spin up test environments quickly.
- Dispose them after use to **save cost**.
- Keep environments consistent and up-to-date.

### 9. **Software Demos**
- Launch on-demand software demos on any cloud.
- Let users customize parameters (e.g., cluster size).
- Ideal for **trial versions** or **sandbox environments**.

## 🧩 Terraform Core Concepts

### 📦 Provider
- Interface between Terraform and cloud platforms.
- Manages cloud resources like compute, storage, networking, etc.

### 🧱 Resource
- Basic building block in Terraform.
- Represents infrastructure elements like VMs, networks, or DNS records.

### 📁 Module
- Group of reusable Terraform configurations.
- Promotes reusability and clean organization.
- Can be used to create multiple instances of similar resources.

### 📂 State
- Stores information about existing infrastructure.
- Helps Terraform determine what changes need to be applied.

### 📤 Output
- Exposes values from Terraform-managed resources.
- Useful for referencing in other configurations or scripts.
