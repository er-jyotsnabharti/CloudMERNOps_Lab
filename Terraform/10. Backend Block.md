# ⚙️ Terraform `terraform` Block

The `terraform` block is a meta-configuration block. It defines settings and behaviors that apply to the Terraform project as a whole.

---

## 🧱 Syntax

```hcl
terraform {
  required_version = ">= 1.0.0"

  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "~> 5.0"
    }
  }

  backend "s3" {
    bucket = "my-tf-state"
    key    = "dev/terraform.tfstate"
    region = "us-east-1"
  }
}
```

## 🗃️ `backend` Block

### 📘 What Is It?

The `backend` block inside `terraform {}` defines where Terraform's state file is stored. By default, it's local, but you can configure remote backends like S3, Azure Blob, GCS, Terraform Cloud, etc.

---

### ✅ Why Use a Remote Backend?

- 🤝 Collaboration with your team
- 🔒 Locking and consistency
- 🛠️ Recovery from local machine failure
- 🌐 Integration with remote tooling (like Terraform Cloud)

### 🔧 Common Backend Types

| **Backend** | **Use Case**                              |
|-------------|------------------------------------------|
| `local`     | Default – stores state in local `.tfstate` |
| `s3`        | AWS S3 bucket (with DynamoDB for locking) |
| `gcs`       | Google Cloud Storage                     |
| `azurerm`   | Azure Blob Storage                       |
| `remote`    | Terraform Cloud / Enterprise             |
| `consul`    | For distributed systems using Consul     |

## 🌩 Example — S3 Backend

```hcl
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket         = "my-terraform-state"
    key            = "env/dev/terraform.tfstate"
    region         = "us-east-1"
    dynamodb_table = "terraform-locks"  # for state locking
    encrypt        = true
  }
}
```

To initialize and configure the backend, run:

```bash
terraform init
```

---

## ☁️ Example — Azure Backend

```hcl
terraform {
  backend "azurerm" {
    resource_group_name  = "tf-state-rg"
    storage_account_name = "tfstorageacct"
    container_name       = "tfstate"
    key                  = "dev.terraform.tfstate"
  }
}
```

## 📦 Notes

- 🛑 **You can only define one backend per Terraform configuration.**
- 🔄 Changing backends requires migrating state (e.g., using `terraform state pull` and `terraform state push`).
- 🚫 **No dynamic expressions** (like variables) are allowed in the `backend` block directly.
