# 📦 Docker Images

Docker images are read-only, self-contained templates used to build containers. They use a layered file system where each layer represents a step, such as installing packages or copying files. This layering approach allows efficient reuse and caching, as only changed layers are rebuilt.

### Ways of Getting Docker Images

#### 1. **Image from Docker Hub**  
   Docker Hub is the default registry for Docker images. You can pull public and private images from it.

   - **Pull a predefined (public) image from Docker Hub**

     ```bash
     docker pull <image-name>
     docker pull <image-name>:<version>
     ```

     Example:

     ```bash
     docker pull node
     docker pull node:18-alpine
     ```

   - **Pull a private image from Docker Hub**  
     First, authenticate with Docker Hub using your credentials:
     ```bash
     docker login
     docker pull username/image:tag
     ```

#### 2. **Create an image from a Dockerfile**

   ![Containers vs VMs](./Visuals/Image%20Creation.png)

   You can define a custom image using a `Dockerfile`. This file contains instructions like the base image, commands to run, files to copy, etc.  
   Example:

   ```bash
   docker build -t my-image-name:tag .
   ```

#### 3. **Create an image from a Docker Container**
   You can create an image from a running or stopped container by committing its current state.

   Example:

   ```bash
   docker commit <container-id> my-image-name:tag
   ```

### Docker Image Commands Table

| Command                                | Description                                                 |
| -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `docker pull <image>`                  | Pulls an image from Docker Hub (latest tag by default).     |
| `docker image ls -q`                   | just display the Image IDs                                  |
| `docker pull <image>:<tag>`            | Pulls a specific version (tag) of the image.                |
| `docker push <image>:<tag>`            | Pushes an image to Docker Hub (requires login).             |
| `docker login`                         | Authenticates to Docker Hub.                                |
| `docker logout`                        | Logs out from Docker Hub.                                   |
| `docker images`                        | Lists all locally available Docker images.                  |
| `docker image ls`                      | Same as `docker images`.                                    |
| `docker image inspect <image>`         | Displays detailed info about an image.                      |
| `docker image history <image>`         | Shows history of an image's layers.                         |
| `docker rmi <image>`                   | Removes a specific Docker image.                            |
| `docker image rm <image>`              | Same as `docker rmi`.                                       |
| `docker tag <source> <target>`         | Tags an image with a new name or version.                   |
| `docker build -t <name>:<tag> .`       | Builds an image from a Dockerfile in the current directory. |
| `docker commit <container-id> <image>` | Creates a new image from a container's current state.       |
| `docker save -o <file>.tar <image>`    | Saves an image to a tar archive.                            |
| `docker load -i <file>.tar`            | Loads an image from a tar archive.                          |
| `docker image prune`                   | Removes unused images to free up space.                     |
| `docker rmi $(docker image ls -q)`     | Delete all docker images at once                            |
| `docker search <image-name>`           | Search images in Docker Hub                                 |

### 📌 Important Notes

- **Layer Caching:**  
  Docker uses layer caching to speed up image builds. If a Dockerfile instruction hasn't changed, Docker reuses the previously cached layer, significantly reducing build time.

- **Layers in Docker Images:**  
  Docker images are made of multiple layers, each created by a Dockerfile instruction (like `RUN`, `COPY`, etc.).

- **Immutability of Layers:**  
  Once a layer is built, it cannot be changed. This immutability allows Docker to efficiently reuse layers, saving both time and disk space.
