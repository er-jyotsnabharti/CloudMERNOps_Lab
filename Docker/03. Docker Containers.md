A Docker container is a runtime instance of a Docker image. They are created by instantiating an image. Docker containers bundle an application along with all of its dependencies into a compact, lightweight package. By leveraging OS-level virtualization, containers can run reliably across a variety of environments.

### Docter Conatiner Lifecycle

![Containers vs VMs](./Visuals/Container%20Lifecycle.jpg)

Docker containers go through several states during their lifecycle. Understanding these states helps with effective container management and debugging.

#### 🔹 Created State

- The container is created using `docker create`, but **not yet running**.
- Configuration, storage volumes, and network interfaces are allocated.
- No processes inside the container have started yet.

#### 🔹 Started (Running) State

- Entered when the container is started using `docker start`.
- The container's main process begins execution.
- Actively uses system resources like CPU and memory.
- Runs the application or service defined in the image.

#### 🔹 Paused State

- Triggered using `docker pause`.
- All processes in the container are **suspended**, halting execution.
- The container retains its memory and resources.
- Useful for temporary halts, debugging, or conserving resources.

#### 🔹 Exited State

- The container’s main process has completed or crashed.
- Entered automatically when the container finishes its task or hits an error.
- Still retains its file system and settings.
- Can be restarted (`docker start`) or removed (`docker rm`).

#### 🔹 Dead State

- Indicates a **critical failure** or abrupt termination.
- The container cannot be restarted.
- Docker daemon may attempt cleanup.
- Manual removal (`docker rm`) is required to free resources.

### 🧰 Docker Container Commands Table

| Command                             | Description                                                   |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `docker create <image>`             | Creates a new container from an image without starting it.    |
| `docker run <image>`                | Creates and starts a container from an image.                 |
| `docker start <container>`          | Starts a previously created/stopped container.                |
| `docker stop <container>`           | Gracefully stops a running container.                         |
| `docker restart <container>`        | Stops and then starts the container again.                    |
| `docker pause <container>`          | Pauses all processes in the container.                        |
| `docker unpause <container>`        | Resumes all processes in a paused container.                  |
| `docker rm <container>`             | Removes a stopped container.                                  |
| `docker container prune`            | To remove all stopped container.                              |
| `docker rm $(docker ps -aq) `       | To remove all containers                                      |
| `docker kill <container>`           | Forcefully stops a container immediately.                     |
| `docker exec -it <container> <cmd>` | Runs a command inside a running container (interactive mode). |
| `docker attach <container>`         | Attaches terminal to a running container's STDIN/STDOUT.      |
| `docker logs <container>`           | Fetches logs from a container.                                |
| `docker ps`                         | Lists all **running** containers.                             |
| `docker ps -a`                      | Lists **all** containers (including stopped).                 |
| `docker inspect <container>`        | Displays detailed configuration of a container.               |
| `docker top <container>`            | Shows running processes in the container.                     |
| `docker stats`                      | Displays real-time resource usage statistics of containers.   |
| `docker rename <old> <new>`         | Renames an existing container.                                |
| `docker cp <container>:<src> <dst>` | Copies files/folders from a container to the host.            |
| `docker cp <src> <container>:<dst>` | Copies files/folders from the host to a container.            |
