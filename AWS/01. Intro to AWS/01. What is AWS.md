## What Is AWS?

### **1. Cloud Computing Overview**

* **Definition** :
* On-demand delivery of IT resources over the internet.
* Based primarily on a pay-as-you-go pricing model.

### **2. Cloud Computing Deployment Models**

* **Purpose** :
* Enables developers and IT teams to focus on core activities.
* Eliminates the need for tasks like hardware procurement, maintenance, and capacity planning.
* **Deployment Strategies** :
* Each method offers varying levels of control, flexibility, and management to meet different needs.

#### **a. On-Premises**

* **Description** :
* Companies host and maintain their own hardware (compute, storage, networking) in self-managed data centers.
* **Challenges** :
* Requires dedicated teams for data center management.
* Involves high costs and can limit flexibility and experimental opportunities.
* **Context** :
* Was the traditional model before the rise of cloud computing.

#### **b. Cloud**

* **Description** :
* IT resources are provided over the internet, eliminating the need for companies to manage their own physical hardware.
* Services are delivered on-demand with pay-as-you-go pricing.
* **Provider Role** :
* Companies like AWS own, maintain, and manage data centers while providing virtualized resources.

#### **c. Hybrid**

* **Description** :
* Combines cloud-based services with on-premises infrastructure.
* **Purpose** :
* Enables organizations to extend existing infrastructure into the cloud.
* Often used to connect cloud resources with in-house systems, providing greater flexibility.

### **3. Comparison: On-Premises vs. Cloud**

* **Scenario Example** :
* **Testing a New Application Feature (QA Environment)** :
  *  **On-Premises Approach** :
  * Requires purchasing and installing hardware, setting up power and networking, and provisioning an environment that mirrors production.
  * Results in increased time and cost.
    *  **Cloud Approach** :
  * Allows rapid replication of a full production environment in minutes or seconds.
  * Eliminates the need for physical setup, reducing time-to-market.
* **Key Benefit** :
* **Removal of “Undifferentiated Heavy Lifting”** :
  * Offloads routine, non-strategic tasks (e.g., hardware installation, maintenance) to AWS.
  * Empowers businesses to focus on core, differentiating aspects like innovative code and unique business processes.

### **4. AWS Role in Cloud Computing**

* AWS provides the fundamental cloud computing services.
* **Use Case Example** :
* For a corporate directory application, AWS services offer:
  * Scalable, highly available, and cost-effective infrastructure.
  * Rapid deployment without the need for heavy-duty physical hardware.

### **5. Six Advantages of Cloud Computing**

#### **a. Pay-As-You-Go**

* You pay only for the resources used.

#### **b. Benefit from Massive Economies of Scale**

* Aggregated usage across many customers lowers costs compared to managing your own infrastructure.

#### **c. Stop Guessing Capacity**

* Capacity can be adjusted on demand:
  * Avoids over-provisioning (idle resources) and under-provisioning (limited capacity).

#### **d. Increase Speed and Agility**

* Resources become available in minutes:
  * Reduces the time required for development and testing.

#### **e. Realize Cost Savings**

* Focus on differentiating projects rather than maintaining and managing data centers.

#### **f. Go Global in Minutes**

* Applications can be deployed across multiple global regions:
  * Offers lower latency and an improved user experience with minimal additional cost.
