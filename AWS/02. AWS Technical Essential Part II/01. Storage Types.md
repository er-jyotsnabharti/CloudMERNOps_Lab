## ☁️ AWS Storage Types: File, Block & Object Explained

### 🔑 Core Concept:

AWS storage services are grouped into 3 primary categories:

1. 📂 **File Storage**
2. 🧱 **Block Storage**
3. 🧺 **Object Storage**

Each type serves different needs, from sharing files to high-speed transactional processing to infinite scalability.

### 📂 1. File Storage

#### 🧠 What It Is:

Data is stored in a hierarchical file-and-folder structure, similar to:

```bash
computer/Application_files/Cat_photos/cats-03.png
```

- 🏷️ Includes metadata like file name, size, creation date.
- 🗂️ Organized for intuitive human and app access.

#### ✅ Ideal Use Cases:

| Use Case                 | Why File Storage?                                                           |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🌐 Web Serving           | Follows common file protocols (NFS, SMB), easy to integrate.                |
| 📊 Analytics             | Supports file locks and partial writes, ideal for big data workflows.       |
| 🎬 Media & Entertainment | Handles rich content, standard file protocols, supports hybrid deployments. |
| 🏠 Home Directories      | Cloud alternative for traditional shared folders (NAS-style).               |

#### 🧰 AWS File Storage Services:

- Amazon EFS (Elastic File System)
- Amazon FSx (for Windows/Lustre)

### 🧱 2. Block Storage

#### 🧠 What It Is:

Breaks files into fixed-size “blocks”, each with a unique address and no extra metadata.

- 🎯 High performance, low latency.
- 🧩 Modifying a small part (e.g. a single character) only requires rewriting the relevant block.

#### ✅ Ideal Use Cases:

| Use Case                   | Why Block Storage?                                                  |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 💳 Transactional Workloads | Fast, fault-tolerant databases and real-time processing.            |
| 📦 Containers              | Migratable, efficient storage for containerized workloads.          |
| 🖥️ Virtual Machines        | Easily attach/detach virtual drives to VMs, format as file systems. |

#### 🧰 AWS Block Storage Services:

- Amazon EBS (Elastic Block Store)
- AWS EC2 Instance Store (ephemeral)

### 🧺 3. Object Storage

#### 🧠 What It Is:

Stores data as self-contained objects with unique IDs, no hierarchy—uses a flat structure.

- 🧾 Each object = data + metadata + unique identifier.
- 🐢 Slower to update: changing 1 character means replacing the entire object.

#### ✅ Ideal Use Cases:

| Use Case             | Why Object Storage?                                          |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 🗄️ Data Archiving    | Cost-effective, durable for compliance and long-term media.  |
| 🛡️ Backup & Recovery | Redundant storage, cross-region replication, fault-tolerant. |
| 🎥 Rich Media        | Optimized delivery of large files (videos, images, music).   |

#### 🧰 AWS Object Storage Services:

- Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)
- S3 Glacier (for archival)

### 🔄 Cloud vs Traditional Storage

| Traditional        | Cloud                 |
| ------------------ | --------------------- |
| 🧱 Block = DAS/SAN | Block = Amazon EBS    |
| 📂 File = NAS      | File = Amazon EFS/FSx |
| 🧺 Object = Rare   | Object = Amazon S3    |

In traditional setups, adding storage was manual and rigid. With cloud? Just a few clicks.
