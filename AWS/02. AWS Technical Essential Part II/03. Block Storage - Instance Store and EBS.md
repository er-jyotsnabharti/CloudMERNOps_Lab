## 🧱 Block Storage Overview

Block storage is the **preferred option** for:

* ✅ Transactional workloads
* ✅ Mission-critical applications
* ✅ I/O-intensive systems

There are **two types of block storage** in AWS:

1. **EC2 Instance Store**
2. **Amazon EBS (Elastic Block Store)**

## ⚡ Amazon EC2 Instance Store

### 📌 Key Characteristics

* 📍 Storage **physically attached** to the host computer
* 🔄  **Ephemeral** : Data is lost when the instance is stopped or terminated
* 🧹 Best for  **temporary data** : caches, buffers, scratch data
* 🤝 Great for **replicated, distributed systems** like Hadoop

### 🔧 Use Cases

* Data that changes frequently
* Applications with built-in replication
* Temporary workloads

---

## 💾 Amazon EBS (Elastic Block Store)

### 📌 Key Characteristics

* 🔌 Acts like an **external drive**
* 📦 Volumes persist **independently** of the EC2 instance
* 🔄 **Detachable and attachable** between EC2 instances in the same Availability Zone
* 🚫 Usually 1-to-1 mapping (except  **Multi-Attach** )

### 🧠 Multi-Attach Feature

* ➕ Allows **io1/io2** volumes to be attached to **multiple EC2 instances**
* 🔒 Only available for specific instance types in the **same AZ**

---

## 📈 Scaling EBS Volumes

### 1️⃣ **Increase Volume Size**

* Up to **64 TiB** for some types (e.g., io2 Block Express)

### 2️⃣ **Attach Multiple Volumes**

* EC2 ➡️ many EBS volumes for increased storage capacity

## 📚 Common EBS Use Cases

| Use Case               | Description                                                   |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🖥️ Operating Systems | Boot volumes (root devices) with EBS-backed AMIs              |
| 🧮 Databases           | Fast, scalable block storage for DBs on EC2                   |
| 🏢 Enterprise Apps     | High availability & durability for business-critical apps     |
| 📊 Big Data Engines    | Data persistence + performance scaling for analytics clusters |

## 📦 EBS Volume Types

### 🔹 **SSD (for transactional workloads)**

| Type    | IOPS      | Max Throughput     | Use Case                                 |
| ------- | --------- | ------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| gp3     | 16,000    | 1,000 MiB/s        | General purpose SSD                      |
| io1/io2 | 64k–256k | 1,000–4,000 MiB/s | High-performance, latency-sensitive apps |

### 🔸 **HDD (for throughput workloads)**

| Type | IOPS | Max Throughput | Use Case                                   |
| ---- | ---- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| st1  | 500  | 500 MiB/s      | Frequently accessed, large data workloads  |
| sc1  | 250  | 250 MiB/s      | Cold storage, infrequent access (cheapest) |

## 🛡️ Amazon EBS Benefits

* ✅ **Replicated** automatically within its Availability Zone
* 🔒 **Encryption** supported at rest and in-transit
* ♻️ **Persistent** storage, even if the instance is stopped
* 🔧 Modify volume type/size/IOPS **on the fly**
* 🧾 Can create **backups** (snapshots) of EBS volumes

---

## 🧱 EBS Snapshots

* 📸 Point-in-time backups of EBS volumes
* 🧠  **Incremental** : only saves changed blocks since last snapshot
* ☁️ Stored redundantly in **Amazon S3**
* 🔁 Used to **restore or clone volumes** across same/different AZs
