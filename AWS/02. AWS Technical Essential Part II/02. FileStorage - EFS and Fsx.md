# 📁 AWS File Storage Services: Amazon EFS & FSx

## ☁️ Overview

AWS offers **managed file storage** solutions that are scalable, secure, and seamlessly integrate with your existing apps — with **no changes to workflows** required.

---

## 📂 Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS)

### 🔧 What is Amazon EFS?

Amazon EFS is a **fully managed, elastic NFS file system** for Linux workloads:

* Grows/shrinks automatically with file additions/removals 📈📉
* No manual provisioning of capacity or performance
* Can connect **multiple (even 1000s) of compute instances** simultaneously
* Consistent performance for each instance

### 🖥️ Integration

* Works with **AWS compute services** (e.g., EC2, Lambda)
* Works with **on-premises systems** via AWS Direct Connect or VPN

### 💡 Key Features

* No minimum fee or setup cost 💰
* Simple web-based UI for quick setup
* Pay only for **actual storage used**

### 🗂️ Storage Classes:

| Class                     | Description                                |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **EFS Standard**    | Multi-AZ, high durability and availability |
| **EFS Standard-IA** | Infrequent access, still Multi-AZ          |
| **EFS One Zone**    | Stored in a single AZ, more cost-efficient |
| **EFS One Zone-IA** | Cheaper infrequent access in a single AZ   |
