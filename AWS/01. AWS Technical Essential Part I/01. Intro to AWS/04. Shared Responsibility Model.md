## 🔐 Security and the AWS Shared Responsibility Model

📌 **Core Principle** :

Security in AWS is a **shared responsibility** between **AWS (the provider)** and **you (the customer)** .

> AWS: **Security _of_ the cloud**
>
> You: **Security _in_ the cloud**

### 🧱 AWS Responsibility: **Security _of_ the Cloud**

✅ AWS is responsible for **protecting the infrastructure** that runs AWS services:

- 🌍 **Physical security** of data centers, Regions, and Availability Zones.
- ⚙️ **Hardware & Software** components like:
  - Servers, storage devices
  - Host operating systems & virtualization
  - Network components

🧪 **Varies by Service Type** :

| Category           | Example Services    | AWS Responsibility                                           |
| ------------------ | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Infrastructure** | Amazon EC2          | Manages infra, networking, and foundational services         |
| **Abstracted**     | Amazon S3, DynamoDB | Manages infra, OS, platform, encryption, and data protection |

🧠 **Cloud Specialist Tip** :

> With **abstracted services** , AWS takes on more operational overhead—making them ideal for scalability and reducing risk. Choose these when you want to **focus on business logic** and not worry about patching/OS updates.

### 👨‍💻 Customer Responsibility: **Security _in_ the Cloud**

✅ Customers are responsible for securing:

- **Their data**
- **Configurations**
- **Applications**
- **Access control**

📊 **Responsibility Depends on Service Type** :

| Category           | Example Services | Customer Responsibility                                |
| ------------------ | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Infrastructure** | Amazon EC2       | Configure OS, apps, firewalls; encrypt and manage data |
| **Abstracted**     | Amazon S3, RDS   | Manage data access, encryption, backup, compliance     |

🔒 Key areas customers must manage:

- Choosing **Regions** (for data sovereignty 🗺️)
- Applying **encryption** and **scheduled backups**
- Managing **IAM policies** , MFA, and **access control**

🧠 **Real-world Cloud Advice** :

- Use **Amazon Inspector** , **GuardDuty** , and **Security Hub** to continuously monitor workloads.
- Enable **logging and auditing** via **AWS CloudTrail** and **CloudWatch Logs** .
- Encrypt **everything by default** —both **at rest** (S3, EBS, RDS) and **in transit** (TLS).

## 🛡️ Summary: Who Does What?

| Area                     | AWS Responsibility | Customer Responsibility |
| ------------------------ | ------------------ | ----------------------- |
| Data Centers & Hardware  | ✅                 | ❌                      |
| Hypervisors & Host OS    | ✅                 | ❌                      |
| IAM, Encryption, Backups | ❌                 | ✅                      |
| Patching EC2 OS & Apps   | ❌                 | ✅                      |
| Access & Identity Mgmt   | ❌                 | ✅                      |

## 📘 Additional Insights (Cloud Specialist View)

🔐 **Never assume AWS secures your data — you do.**

- Misconfigured S3 buckets = 💣 biggest cause of data leaks.
- Use **S3 Block Public Access** and **Object Lock** to prevent accidental exposure.

👨‍💼 **Enterprise Readiness Tip** :

- Align the shared responsibility model with your **compliance frameworks** like:
  - **ISO 27001** , **SOC 2** , **HIPAA** , **GDPR** , etc.
- Use **AWS Artifact** to access audit reports and compliance documents.
