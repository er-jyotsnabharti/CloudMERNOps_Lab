## 🛡️ Amazon VPC Security

AWS security is **top priority** , and VPC security offers two main layers:

1. **Network ACLs** (subnet-level, stateless)
2. **Security Groups** (instance-level, stateful)

---

### 🔃 1. **Network ACLs (NACLs)** – Subnet-Level Firewall

#### 📌 What is a Network ACL?

- Acts like a **firewall at the subnet level** .
- Allows or denies **specific inbound and outbound traffic** .
- **Stateless** : responses must be explicitly allowed in both directions.

#### 🔧 Default Network ACL

- **Inbound** : ALLOW all → rule `100`
- **Outbound** : ALLOW all → rule `100`
- Catch-all `*` rule: DENY (implicit fallback)

➡️ Default ACLs are **open** to allow free communication — a good starting point.

#### 🔐 Custom Network ACL Example:

**Inbound Rules**

| Rule | Protocol | Port | Source IP    | Action | Comment          |
| ---- | -------- | ---- | ------------ | ------ | ---------------- |
| 100  | TCP      | 443  | 0.0.0.0/0    | ALLOW  | HTTPS traffic    |
| 130  | TCP      | 3389 | 192.0.2.0/24 | ALLOW  | RDP from home IP |
| \*   | All      | All  | All          | DENY   | Block all others |

**Outbound Rules**

| Rule | Protocol | Port Range  | Destination IP | Action | Comment          |
| ---- | -------- | ----------- | -------------- | ------ | ---------------- |
| 120  | TCP      | 1025–65535 | 0.0.0.0/0      | ALLOW  | Response traffic |
| \*   | All      | All         | 0.0.0.0/0      | DENY   | Catch-all deny   |

> 📌 **Ephemeral Ports (1025–65535)** must be allowed in outbound rules to respond to incoming HTTPS.

#### 🚨 Key Notes:

- NACLs are **stateless** ➝ both **inbound and outbound** rules are required for bidirectional traffic.
- You can use NACLs to **add another layer of defense** (e.g., block suspicious IPs).
- Ideal for **broad subnet-level rules** (e.g., DMZ-style filtering).

### 🧱 2. **Security Groups (SGs)** – Instance-Level Firewall

#### 📌 What is a Security Group?

- Acts like a **virtual firewall for EC2 instances** .
- **Stateful** : if a request goes out, the response is automatically allowed back in.
- You only need to define **inbound rules** for allowed incoming connections.

#### 🔧 Default Behavior:

- **Inbound** : ❌ Blocked (no access by default)
- **Outbound** : ✅ Allowed (full egress)

> ✅ Responses to **outgoing connections** are automatically allowed due to statefulness.

#### 📥 Example Inbound Rules:

| Type  | Protocol  | Port | Source    | Purpose     |
| ----- | --------- | ---- | --------- | ----------- |
| HTTP  | TCP (4/6) | 80   | 0.0.0.0/0 | Web traffic |
| HTTPS | TCP (4/6) | 443  | 0.0.0.0/0 | Secure web  |

#### 🧱 Use Case: 3-Tier Architecture

| Layer    | Allowed Inbound     | Notes                        |
| -------- | ------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Web Tier | HTTPS from Internet | Public-facing EC2            |
| App Tier | HTTP from Web Tier  | Internal business logic      |
| DB Tier  | MySQL from App Tier | Secure access to RDS backend |

> 📌 Use **security groups to segregate tiers** (like VLANs but virtual) and allow specific app-level communication.

### 🧠 Cloud Engineer Insights

🔹 **When to Use What**

| Layer          | Use Case                     | Key Feature |
| -------------- | ---------------------------- | ----------- |
| NACL           | Subnet-level filtering       | Stateless   |
| Security Group | EC2 instance-level filtering | Stateful    |

🔹 **Best Practices**

- Start with **default NACL** , then customize only if needed.
- Always define **least privilege rules** .
- Combine **NACLs + SGs** for defense-in-depth.
- Regularly audit rules and **document all open ports** .
- Use **CIDR-based restrictions** for tighter access control (e.g., home IPs, office networks).
