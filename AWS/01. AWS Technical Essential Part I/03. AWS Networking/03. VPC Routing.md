## 🚦 Amazon VPC Routing

### 🧭 What is a Route Table?

A **route table** is a set of **rules (routes)** that determine **how network traffic is directed** within a VPC.

Each route has:

* A **destination CIDR block** (e.g., `0.0.0.0/0`)
* A **target** (e.g., `igw-xxxx`, `nat-gateway`, `local`, etc.)

---

### 📘 Main Route Table (Default)

* Created **automatically** when you create a VPC.
* **Default behavior** : Allows traffic between all **local subnets** in the VPC (`local` route).
* Used **implicitly** by subnets **not associated** with any custom route table.

#### 🔒 Rules for Main Route Table:

* ❌ Cannot **delete** it.
* ❌ Cannot make a **gateway route table** the main one.
* ✅ Can **edit** (add/remove) routes.
* ✅ Can **explicitly associate** subnets with it (even if already implicitly associated).
* ✅ Can **replace** it with a custom route table.

### 🧰 Custom Route Tables

Used when you want **fine-grained control** over routing for each subnet.

#### 🎯 Use Case:

* Create a **frontend subnet** with internet access.
* Create a **backend subnet** (e.g., DB) with  **no internet access** .
* Assign a **different route table** to each.

#### Key Points:

* Each custom route table  **includes the local route by default** .
* Subnets **explicitly associated** with a custom route table will **ignore** the main route table.
* Keeps your architecture  **secure and modular** .

> 📌 Best Practice:
>
> * Use **custom route tables** for each subnet.
> * Keep the main route table untouched for safety and clarity.

### 🧠 Cloud Engineer Insights

* 📦 All resources in the same VPC **can communicate** via the `local` route.
* 🌍 To allow  **internet access** :
  * Add `0.0.0.0/0` pointing to an **Internet Gateway (IGW)** in the route table.
* 🔒 For **private subnets** with  **outbound-only internet** , use a **NAT Gateway** in the route table.
* 🧩 Use **route table segmentation** to isolate environments (e.g., Dev, Test, Prod).
* 🔍 Always verify **route table associations** when debugging connectivity issues.
